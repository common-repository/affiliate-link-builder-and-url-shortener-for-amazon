When posting, trims Amazon links from queries and appends your Amazon affiliate ID (tag) at the end of each one. Then it uses the URL shortening service bit.ly to generate pretty amzn.to links

== Description ==
With this plugin, all you need to do is paste any number of standard Amazon product links into a new blog post and hit publish.

It will automatically detect the presence of Amazon links in a blog post and convert them: It will remove the query, including a possible existing affiliate ID. Then it will append your affiliate ID at the end of the URL.

Optionally, you can even have the plugin shorten the link using Amazon's own URL shortening service amzn.to (powered by bit.ly). You will get a short link that looks like this: https://amzn.to/XXXXXXX. Perfect for sharing on social media!

If you opt for using bit.ly, you also get access to click analytics (total clicks per link, referrers, locations) by logging in to your bit.ly account.

The plugin has its own settings page, where you can provide your Amazon Affiliate ID and and bit.ly Generic Access Token (optional). To request an access token, sign up for bit.ly and verify your email address.

Additionally, you can control whether the links should be made "nofollow" and/or opened in a new browser tab.
